In this game, you have the option to enter you name with a pop-up modal.
If you enter your name, it displays on your board, if not, there is a default name.
You place your ship by highlighting your board and it iterates through your available ships.
Once all ships are placed, the game begins.
You click each square to attack, if you hit the enemy ship, there is an animation of a red dot that swells, and returns to normal.
Any miss is a blue square.
Once all ships are sunk, the game ends with a pop-up modal declaring the winner.
Computer randomly places ships, and randomly guesses.
